            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>     
                Hello! My name is Ma Angelica Ramirez. My family and friends call me Angelica. My pronouns are she and her. I was born on the 18<sup>th</sup> of October in Manila, Philippines. The country, which consists of over 7,000 islands, has an abundance of beautiful beaches and marine life. Growing up, I got to go on beach holidays almost twice every year and I developed a liking for several water sports, such as free-diving.

                Freediving is a form of underwater diving. Rather than using breathing equipment, one needs to hold their breath and dive as deep as possible. Prior to doing any training, I can only hold my breath for 60 seconds, but now I can hold it for almost 4 minutes. In 2018, I completed a free-diving course and gained my <abbr title="Apnea Academy">AA</abbr> Level 1 certification. Some people might find it scary, but it is quite relaxing and in a way meditative for me.
